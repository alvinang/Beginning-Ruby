## Bot App

This Ruby app is created based on the Chapter 12 of the book ["Beginning Ruby"](http://beginningruby.org/) by Peter Cooper.
This app is created on October 6th, 2013 using Ruby 2.0.0p267.

### What does it do?

The goal for this bot is to respond to your chat/conversation with it. In essence, since this bot app is not fully
optimized, it is created to annoy you.

To enjoy kickstart this process, download this app and do the following in your directory (using terminal):

```irb
ruby basic_client.rb 'Fred' 'fred.bot'
```
